# Toolkit
A collection of utility tooling, libraries and other elements used in various
projects (some of which appear in other associated repositories, just in case
you see commonalities).  Basically a lifetime of bits and pieces of code that
have been released or should have been released into the public domain.  YMMV!

## Code Compilation
In general, the toolkit is just a bunch of random bits of code.  It doesn't
really build into a complete product, so to speak.  But for maintenance/updates
the various parts that can compile, will.

The bulk of the 'compiling' code is written in C and uses the autoconf tooling
on Unix-derived systems.  To build from raw source, run `autoreconf -vfi` to
rebuild the `configure` script and then follow the standard processes for
autoconf-based code compilation.

For the windows side of the world, it is still `make` driven, but in this
instance the environment is a bit more restricted, so autoconf is not needed.
Makefile.win (and its counterparts) are used in this case to compile the code.
Oh - did I mention that it is really intended for cross-compiler environments?

## Intents and Contexts

The remainder of the README (the following sections) attempt to give some
context and descriptions to the origins and intents of the various bits found
in this toolkit.  That may provide clues to an intended or possible use for
the underlying code (or even just an understanding of it...)

### db

Originally, this was going to be a separate repository, to keep toolkit
independent of database library dependencies.  But that is solved with proper
autoconf determinations.  There is also the fact that a lot of the db
facade implementation uses various bits from historical pieces of the toolkit
elements, so it just belongs here.  So here it is, a generic database api
facade/abstraction that standardizes common database actions across multiple
engine implementations.  Note that the facade implementation originates from
the original MTraq 'database' engine, so some of the oldest code in the toolkit
can be found here (with lots of cleanup), since influenced by the adventures of
xkoto and more modern abstraction systems like PDO.

Addendum: as 20 years of code was reviewed and merged (in various forms), it
mutated over time from a local caching model (from the original database engine)
towards a referential model (like ODBC). A lot of history in there based on
the evolution of knowledge and the database interface world in general.
The final winner of the merging was a simplified model where the database
content is locally pulled in single row fashion, with metadata.  Simple
interface for basic database operations that do not need high-volume or
high performance processing support.  If you need that, then ODBC-based drivers
are the choice (and at some point the ODBC skeletons from the older MTraq
engines might be included but that has some significant entanglements over the
years).  In that same vein, the data interfaces are predominantly string based,
both for simplicity and support of the lowest common denominator across the
database platforms.  Minor performance impact (maybe) but alternative
interfaces should be used if that level of performance is required.

### lang

This directory contains various language parsing/processing implementations,
both for data encoding as well as execution frameworks.  They have varying
levels of 'compliance' with the associated language specifications.

### network

Over twenty+ years, I seem to continuously repeat a cycle of application
development patterns.  One stage in the cycle involves creating code related to
network/wire protocol processing (I can write wireshark tracing plugins in my
sleep now).  This directory contains a library of functional enclosures of
common network processing elements (sockets and the like) designed to be
used in cross-platform development environments.  If I've built an application
or a component that utilized low-level networking (and wasn't written in Perl)
then it used some form or components of this library.  Note that this library
isn't really intended to be used verbatim (as a generic library), rather, use
it as a starting point and customize it to your application requirements.

This directory also includes a basic multi-threaded server/engine that can be
used as the basis for a daemon/server application that listens for and processes
requests from clients.  This originated from the HTTP request server that was
built to service operational requests for a distributed agent platform but has
been used for other direct protocol servers (including client emulation).

Note: The original forms of this library incorporated a custom built security
layer.  Best practice (now, well, even then) would dictate using audited code
like OpenSSL, HeartBleed bug notwithstanding.  Some remnants might remain...

### utility

This directory contains various 'standard' data structures and algorithms used
throughout the toolkit (or as part of other assemblies).  Probably a lot of
CS### homework assignments might be found in here...
